Reflection:
* In order to create this application I used two different environments
   1. Linux Mint Machine
   2. Mas OSX Machine

* I was able to get the application up and running in the same manner as that of the
  text book on my Mac OSX but was not able to get it working properly on my Linux
  machine.

* I created a repository on both Heroku and GitHub that I will continually update
  both repositories.

* It was easier to find installation and helpful instructions relating to my Mac than
  my Linux machine

* More than likely I will be using my Mac to code anything associated with bootstrap,
  NodeJS, AngularJS, and ExpressJs.
